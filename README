This distribution contains the source code for the experiments presented in
the following research publication:

    Xiao Ling and Daniel S. Weld (2012). "Fine-Grained Entity Recognition", 
    in Proceedings OF THE TWENTY-SIXTH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL 
    INTELLIGENCE (AAAI), 2012.

It includes algorithms for learning and inference, taking input of plain 
text for prediction. 

It uses the following external libraries:
trove.jar(3.0.1): http://trove.starlight-systems.com/
commons-lang.jar(2.4): http://commons.apache.org/lang/
protobuf-java-2.4.1.jar(2.4.1): http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
Stanford CoreNLP(1.3.0): http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml

To make predictions on new test data, change the fields "testFile" and 
"outputFile" in the file "config/figer.conf" to your desired files. Note 
that "testFile" MUST take a file with .txt extension. Then run:

  ./run.sh config/figer.conf &> figer.log

To run the experiments in the AAAI-12 paper, you can proceed as follows:

  ./run.sh aaai/exp.conf &> aaai/exp.log
